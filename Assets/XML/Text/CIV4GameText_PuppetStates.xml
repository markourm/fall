		<English>[H1]Puppet States[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]Puppet States can be formed when a civilization with knowledge of how to form Vassal States conquers a city. Puppet States are created as a Vassal of the conquering player, and are the same civilization type as the previous city owner. Puppet States are a special type of vassal in that they don't get a Palace and are permanently a Vassal unless they achieve Legitimacy. A Puppet State achieves Legitimacy when it is the last remaining civ of it's civilization type. At that point it becomes a regular Vassal rather than a Puppet State.</English>
